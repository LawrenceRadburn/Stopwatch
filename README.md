# Stopwatch
 This was the first stopwatch I made using an online tutorial
 With the help of <a href="https://github.com/cathydutton">Cathy Dutton's</a> <a href="https://codepen.io/cathydutton/pen/xxpOOw">JavaScript Stopwatch on CodePen"</a>. I was able to follow along and create my first stopwatch using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
